# OSTEP

The repository contains learning material for *Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces* (OSTEP for short). 

## Repository Structure

The `./bookcode/` directory contains example codes in OSTEP, part of which are slightly adapted. The `./homework/` directory contains homework codes of OSTEP.

## Book Notes & Homework

Book Notes and homework solutions are available in my blogs. Follow the liks for reference. (Updating...)
